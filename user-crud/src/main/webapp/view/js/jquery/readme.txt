- This folder may contain some JQuery plugin to support the front end functionality implemented in the JSPs or combine them with ExtJS. As an example, 
JQuery Form plugin has been included here (not referenced by any JSP yet). This plugin along with defined "piece" layout and some jQuery UI (or even another
UI framework which doesn't collide with jQuery) can be used to implement AJAX forms in a clean way. 

- Singletons, classes or custom plugins or any jQuery-related stuff should be included in this folder
