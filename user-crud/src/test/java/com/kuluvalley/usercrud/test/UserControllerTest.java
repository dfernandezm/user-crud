/**
 * A class with implementation of tests to check the correct behaviour of web or endpoint operations. These tests can 
 * be automated through specific frameworks. It is important in order to know for sure that everything works in every stage
 * of the development process.
 * 
 * The tests for the controller should check every URL of the application:
 *  
 *   - Check that it doesn't throw an error
 *   - Provide the expected behaviour and check the results against it
 *   - Force errors (checked and unchecked errors)
 * 
 * 
 * A more manual approach would consist in the following (can be applied in any stage of the development process):
 * 
 * - Define a checklist consisting of a set of action vs. expected result pairs using the requirements (or use case) document 
 * - If possible automate the action-result checking, if not, describe how to launch the action interacting with the application
 * - Run the checklist in a regular basis, make note of the results
 * - Create issues with errors, correct and repeat test
 * - Add new pairs to the checklist and keep them ranked in some way
